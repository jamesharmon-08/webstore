# webstore
Day96 of 100DaysOfCode Today I was challenged to build a custom webstore.  The 'store' should keep track of inventory and keep a payment system.

I used SQLAlchemy for the db portion of the webstore.  I kept track of users using werkzeug.security that kept a secure login.  The webstore framework was using
Flask and Bootstrap.  

If I am to return to this project I will add the payment processing using stripe.api.  Even though it was near complete I find it hard to become motivated with 
these types of projects.
